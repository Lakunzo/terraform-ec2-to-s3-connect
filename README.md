# Attach s3 bucket to an EC2 instance
## Project Overview

This project will give an EC2 instance access to a specific S3 bucket. It will allow the EC2 instance to list, get, put and delete objects in the S3 bucket. It leverages **Amazon IAM**, **S3** and **EC2** to provide access to resources in the bucket. It demonstrates how Infrastructure as a Code using Terraform can be used to deploy such a scenario in a matter of seconds.
